# Vanilla Page

This is a simple landing page built with `Pug`, `SCSS`, and vanilla `JavaScript`. It must be tempting to use `create-react-app` for every pet project, but we are missing out a lot of features React has to offer if we use it for a dead-simple landing page.

## Atomic Design Methodolgy + BEM + Common Sense
---
Thanks to Daniel Tonon for [this great article](https://css-tricks.com/abem-useful-adaptation-bem/). He encourages us to combine modified BEM naming convention with atomic design methodology. He also wrote pros and cons for his approach and let us decide and manage the trade off.

## How About Component Based UI?
---
`Pug` is enough for a presentational component. I use `mixin` to separate elements of the page. It's dead simple but powerful. Thanks `Pug`!

## Demo

Here is the [demo](https://miayam.io/vanilla-page). I am happy with the result. It loads pretty fast. To be honest it's more performant than React.js "Hello World!" because it's a static prerendered page. Thanks `Pug`!
